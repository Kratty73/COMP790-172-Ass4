## About The Project

The application consists of a ball that is always thrown at the user at high speed and the user should try to catch it (A good soccer practice :gloves:	 :soccer:	:grin:)

Demo can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1gDju2lz74)

Took some help from the demo to add hand tracking in quest 2 [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs5C01sDF88).
